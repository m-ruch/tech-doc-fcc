## About
The Technical Documentation Page project is part of freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design course. To see my finished demo, [look here](https://m-ruch.github.io/tech-doc-fcc/).

The project built on the following lessons:

    * CSS Pseudo Selectors
    * Intermediate CSS
    * Responsive Web Design
